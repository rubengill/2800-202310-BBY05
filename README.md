Here are the steps ...

* Upon clicking Continue, we are taken to the Main page of the app
* Here, we have access to the Practice Room by clicking 'Begin Lesson'
* The Practice Room assigns 5 songs to the user as a challenge, they are asked to try playing those songs in their own time
* The second icon in the footer redirects us to the Friends page, where we can search for and/or remove friends
* The third icon is our Search page, where users can search for whatever song they desire
* The fourth icon, is the Favorites page, where the user can view songs that they have saved for easy access
* The fifth icon is the Settings page, from where the user has the option to signout of their current account and is redirected to the login page
* Lastly, the first icon sends us back to the Main page
* If the user wants to access/modify their profile info, the 'Profile' button on the top-right corner will help them do just that
* The user can change their Email ID, username, favorite genre and even their password
